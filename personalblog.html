            <h2> 1. Traveling is easier than you think. </h2>
            <p>We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be
                able to do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple
                months traveling this beautiful planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. It’s up to you to make
                the dream come true and take the first step. Launch TripPlanner to piece together and price your ideal
                route. Not sure where to start? You can always call one of our travel consultants and get some
                complimentary advice!</p>

            <h2>2. Travel opens your eyes.</h2>
            <p>If you’re open and willing, travel will make you an incredibly more well-rounded human being. And that’s
                really the goal, isn’t it? If you don’t know where to start, check out our Around the World planning
                guide.</p>

            <h2> 3. Traveling helps you learn who you are.</h2>
            <p>All the challenges and opportunities travel lays at your feet help you discover who you are in a way
                that’s only possible on the road.</p>

            <h2> 4. Travel creates meaningful relationships </h2>
            <p> People you meet while on the road become some of the most valued names on your contact list. They
                become places on the map to visit later on. These folks give you a glimpse outside your hometown circle
                of friends, and force you to take in new and refreshing perspectives, and ultimately realize that
                everyone is the same.</p>

            <h2> 5. Traveling develops skills you didn’t know you had </h2>
            <p> Sometimes it’s only far from home that you realize you you’ve got skills you’ve never used. It’s travel
                that brings them to the surface and makes you smile, satisfied to have reached the mountain top, or
                crossed a gorge or helped a villager clean up after a storm, or even to have successfully ordered a
                meal at a rural Chinese restaurant.</p>

            <h2> 6. Travel helps you learn new languages</h2>
            <p> There’s something satisfying about being able to throw around a few words of Greek, knowing how to say
                thanks in Thai, pulling out that long dormant Spanish to book a room in Santiago, or simply hearing a
                language you didn’t know existed just a few weeks before.</p>

            <h2> 7. Travel means adventure</h2>
            <p> Zip-lining over the jungle canopy in Peru, successfully navigating the maze-like streets of Venice,
                bartering for the best price in the traditional markets of Marrakech, taking a speedboat ride in New
                Zealand, or hopping in a Land Rover and heading out to watch animals grazing in Tanzania: these are
                adventures worth having. People are hardwired for the excitement of adventure and travel may just be
                the best way to tap into it.</p>

            <h2> 8. Traveling gives you perspective</h2>
            <p> Meeting people from other cultures will teach you that the way you’ve been looking at the world isn’t
                the way everybody else does. In fact, your point-of-view might have some major blind spots. Seeing the
                world for yourself will improve your vision and your grip on reality.</p>

            <h2> 9. Travel helps you move forward</h2>
            <p> If you’re between jobs, schools, kids, or relationships, around the world travel can be a perfect way
                to move from one of these life stages into your next great adventure. A big trip won’t just ease your
                transition into the next stage of your life, it’ll give you a chance to reflect on where you’ve been,
                where you’re going, and where you want to end up.</p>

            <h2> 10. Travel is education</h2>
            <p> Seeing the world provides an education that’s absolutely impossible get in school. Travel teaches you
                economy, politics, history, geography, and sociology in an intense, hands-on way no class will.
                Fortunately, the school of travel is always taking applications, no entrance exam required.</p>
